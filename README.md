- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mohammad Mawassi. I am Lebanese, 24 years old. I graduated Lebanese International University (LIU) in February 2021 with a computer science degree.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Front-end Web Development on Scrimba.com. My Goal right now is to train as much as I can and find a job in another country , since 
we have an economic crisis right now in Lebanon.
